## Project Goals
The goal of this project is to:
1. Review basic Object Oriented Principles
2. Allow students to explore using the Python programming language

## Program
A *simple* Black Jack game: play should occur based on the following rules https://bicyclecards.com/how-to-play/blackjack/.

### Requirements
Implement a Black Jack game which only needs to accommodate one player. There should be a "dealer" following the Dealer's Play rules. Your code should be modular and follow best Object Oriented Programming practices.

Betting is not necessary, nor is a fancy UI (although you can implement them if you want). A player should be dealt cards according to the rules of the game, and they should be able to progress through a hand until they've won or loss. They should be able to play multiple hands until they choose to quit the game.
