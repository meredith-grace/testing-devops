Grace Meredith & Matthew Stenvold 
Activity 4 test plan

For this activity we will be using the big bang approach, meaning all the relationships tested will be integrated together, then tested as a single unit.

The relationships we will be testing are such as follows:
	- btw customer, wishlist, & book (altogether)
	- btw store, inventory & book (altogether)
